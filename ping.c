/*
    We declare like before first our datapacket and the needed header. More we put the
    dataconent. We will send the string that "test" contains as datacontent. That dos not have a
    deeper meaning, but bring the usage of the dataarea nearer to the user. Now we check if the
    programm is called corectly. The first argument has to be the source IP-adress and the second
    argument has to be the dest IP-adress. Then it is time to fill the ip-header. Then we create
    us our ICMP-raw-socket and realise now a new function.

    Throughthis form of call of the function, we have the kernel to keep his hands off of our
    selfcreated datapacket. If we would not use this function, the kernel would more bad than
    good define the fields like ip-source. The konstant "IP_HDRINCL" tells the kenel, that the /////////IP_HDRINCL 
    ip-header should be untouched. We donÂ´t go deeper into this function, cause we only need this
    function in this form. For more Information.:
